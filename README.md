import axios from 'axios';

axios.get('https://api.example.com/suppliers')
     .then(response => {
         // Handle successful response
     })
     .catch(error => {
         // Handle error
     });
```

## Geolocation and Map Display
- Use Leaflet API to display the geolocation of suppliers:
   ```javascript
   import L from 'leaflet';

   const map = L.map('map').setView([latitude, longitude], zoomLevel);
   L.tileLayer('https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png').addTo(map);
   ```
